// DiContainerMiddleware creates a request-scoped sub-container off the given app
// container, stores it in the Fiber locals so handlers can resolve request-scoped
// dependencies, and — the load-bearing part — RELEASES it when the request is done.
//
// ⚠️ THE MIDDLEWARE THAT CREATES THE CONTAINER OWNS ITS LIFETIME. Handlers must NOT
// call `ctn.Delete()`; they only read the container out of the locals. A
// handler-owned lifetime cannot cover a request that never reaches a handler: this
// middleware is mounted globally, ahead of the routes, so it has already built a
// sub-container by the time anything decides the request is not going to reach a
// handler — a rate-limit 429, `/assets`, `/tomatime.svg`, a 404, every SPA catch-all
// render. `sarulabs/di` keeps every sub-container in its parent's `children` map
// until it is deleted, so each of those requests would retain its container for the
// life of the PROCESS, and those leaking paths are the cheap, unauthenticated ones an
// attacker picks. Only the creator can release it.
//
// The release is a `defer`, so it also runs while a panic unwinds and on any error
// return. The container lifetime therefore does NOT depend on whether the recover
// middleware is mounted inside or outside this one — both orders are pinned by the
// tests, which leaves internal/server free to choose that position on other grounds.
//
// DeleteWithSubContainers, not Delete: Delete is conditional — with any child present
// it merely sets `deleteIfNoChild` and returns nil, leaving the container in the
// parent's children map, which is precisely the leak. The single owner of a lifetime
// needs an unconditional release. Safe as long as nothing uses the container after
// its handler returns — no streaming response (SendStream/SetBodyStreamWriter) and no
// goroutine that resolves from it. That is a precondition of this design: if you hand
// a request-scoped dependency to a goroutine that outlives the request, this release
// becomes a use-after-free and the ownership has to be rethought, not worked around.
