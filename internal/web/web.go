// Package web embeds the built React UI into the binary at compile time, so the
// server is a single self-contained artifact (no need to ship internal/web/dist
// alongside the binary or run from a specific working directory).
//
// The assets are produced by `make build-web` into internal/web/dist. That step
// MUST run before `go build` — go:embed reads the files at compile time. A
// committed .gitkeep keeps the directory (and the embed pattern) valid on a fresh
// checkout before any build; the real bundle then fills it in.
